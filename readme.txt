== Testing ==

We would strongly recommend implementing this extension in a development environment before putting it live. For this, to function you need to setup the Woocommerce store to use the test account details as supplied by the Barclaycard ePDQ team. 

We would also recommend that you set up the "test" Barclays back office and enable the test mode within Woocommerce. The Barclays test environment looks like this:
